I want to collect some questions while preparing for my job seeking process. And I am very likely to search the answer on Google. So it might not be perfect. Feel free to point out any thoughts you have.

Hope it helps to some extent.



# Conceptual Questions

**Prediction VS Forecasting**

Forecasting would be a subset of prediction. Any time you predict into the future it is a forecast. 

All forecasts are predictions, but not all predictions are forecasts, as when you would use regression to explain the relationship between two variables.

**Correlation vs Casuation**

Correlation does not imply causation. Causation explicitly applies to cases where action A causes outcome B.
